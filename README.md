# Fortnite Manifest Archive
Manifests can be used for downloading diffrent versions of Fortnite.

**NOTE:Some builds can take up a lot of space so i recommend compressing them with https://github.com/Freaky/Compactor**

# How can i help?
If you ever used Manifests, there's a chance you have them somewhere on your drive. You can Send them to me on Discord (Kyiro#4383) or make a PR. I'd appriceate it

For Legendary, it should be in `%userprofile%/.config/legendary/manifests`
# How to use manifest files?

**Very Easy Way:**

NOTE: This is using a modified version of Legendary and needs no auth. (Made by Lupus)

Download the latest release of the EasyInstaller (EasyInstaller.exe), open it, select the version you want to download and then provide a directory for it to install in.

**Easy Way:**

Requirement: Legendary in PATH


If you never used Legendary before, I recommend reading its [README](https://github.com/derrod/legendary/blob/master/README.md)

NOTE: Please update Legendary before using it.

Download legendary_launch.bat from the repo and the manifest you want to install and follow the GIF below.

**Manually:**

If you're using Legendary, use the `--manifest` flag along with a path to a .MANIFEST file.
For example:

    legendary -v -y install --manifest "D:/Games/FortniteVersions/4.1.manifest" --download-only --no-install --game-folder "GAME-FOLDER" Fortnite
