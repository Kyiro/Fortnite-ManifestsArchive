# How can i help?
If you ever used Manifests, there's a chance you have them somewhere on your drive. You can Send them to me on Discord (Kyiro#4383) or make a PR. I'd appriceate it

For Legendary, it should be in `%userprofile%/.config/legendary/manifests`
# How to use manifest files?
Requirement: Legenday in PATH


If you never used Legendary before, I recommend reading its [README](https://github.com/derrod/legendary/blob/master/README.md)

**Easy Way:**

NOTE: Please update Legendary before using it.

Download legendary_launch.bat from the repo and the manifest you want to install and follow the GIF below.

**Very Easy Way:**

NOTE: This is using a modified version of Legendary and needs no auth. (Made by Lupus)

Download the latest release of the EasyInstaller and open `start_download.bat` to start the downloader and select a version and a path to download the version you want.

**Manually:**

If you're using Legendary, use the `--manifest` flag along with a path to a .MANIFEST file.
For example:

    legendary -v -y install --manifest "D:/Games/FortniteVersions/4.1.manifest" --download-only --no-install --game-folder "GAME-FOLDER" Fortnite
