# Fortnite Manifest Archive
Manifests can be used for downloading diffrent versions of Fortnite.
# How can i help?
If you ever used Manifests, there's a chance you have them somewhere on your drive. You can Send them to me on Discord (Kyiro#4383) or make a PR. I'd appriceate it

For Legendary, it should be in `%userprofile%/.config/legendary/manifests`
# How to use manifest files?
Requirement: Legenday in PATH


If you never used Legendary before, I recommend reading its [README](https://github.com/derrod/legendary/blob/master/README.md)
**Easy Way:**
Download legendary_launch.bat from the repo and the manifest you want to install and follow the GIF below.

**Manually:**
If you're using Legendary, instead of using the `--manifest` flag, you have to use `--delta-manifest` along with a path to a .MANIFEST file.
For example:

    legendary -v -y install --delta-manifest "D:/Games/FortniteVersions/4.1.manifest" --download-only --no-install --game-folder "GAME-FOLDER" Fortnite
